# Python Learning 



## Purpose Of This Repo

The purpose of this repo is to study and research the fundamentals of python and its various packages and libraries. The repo contains a notebook for numpy, iris data set, MNIST and a digit recognition script as well as details on how to run the script.

### Numpy 
Numpy was my first step into the world of python and It was rather simple to grasp and understand. The notebook shows various features of the numpy library such as functions to manipulate random data and different types of distribution plots.

Give examples

### Iris Dataset

This notebook is slightly incomplete. The neural network isnt working right (Im not sure) but its purpose is to contain documentation on the iris data set that is used for machine learning. The notebook contains information about the set itself as well as various plots and distributions showing the differences in size of the Iris flowers. It is ment to contain an example of a neural network detecting which type of Iris plants data is shown but it is not working correctly. (I think)

### MNIST

The MNIST dataset notebook contains information about MNIST's digit recognition library for machine learning. The notebook has the training files from MNISTS main website and shows you how to open them with gzip. It also contains a for loop that loops through each image and saves it to your file directory as well as other various features of MNIST and OpenCv. 

### Digit recognition

This notebook is unifished, as well as the script. The purpose of it is for Digit recognition using a Keras neural network. It is ment to allow the user to show the model an image and see if it can predict what that image is. For now it only shows prediction scores between different epochs agiants the MNIST dataset.
